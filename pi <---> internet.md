# overview
i wanna let the internet talk to servers on my raspberry pi. How do i go about doing this?

according to some resources, here are the general steps:
1. assign a static ip address to the pi on the local network
2. update the configuration of your router to port forward inbound traffic to your pi


# assign static ip address to your pi
the raspberry pi defaults to using a dynamic IP address assigned by the DHCP server (most likely your network router). we want to set it to be static instead.
### network information
we need to learn a bit about our network before we do anything.

1. get the **default gateway ip**. this is the local ip address of our router. all connected devices talk to this in order to access the internet or other devices connected on the local network.
   ```shell
   $ netstat -nr
   Kernel IP routing table
   Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
   0.0.0.0         192.168.66.1    0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 wlan0
   192.168.66.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 wlan0
   ```
   we can see that `192.168.66.1` is our *gateway ip*.
2. get the **DNS server ip**. this is most likely the same as the gateway ip since your router might be acting as your DNS server.
   ```shell
   $ cat /etc/resolv.conf
   # Generated by resolvconf
   nameserver 192.168.66.1
   ```
3. get our pi's **local ip** address and broadcast address
   ```shell
   $ ip -a addr show | grep global
   inet 192.168.66.145/24 brd 192.168.66.255 scope global wlan0
   ```
### update dhcpcd.conf
we need to now tell the dhcp server that we don't want a dynamic ip address, but we will be using a static one. we can do this by making some updates to the `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` file. this file is the configuration for the dhcp client daemon which runs on our pi and communicates with the dhcp server. Here are the changes we need to make to `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`:
```shell
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.66.145/24
static routers=192.168.66.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.66.1
```
in the changes above, we are using the info we gathered previously and mapped
* *ip_address* <--> *local ip*
* *routers* <--> *gateway ip*
* *domain_name_servers* <--> *DNS server ip*

### reboot your pi
# update router config to port forward inbound trafic to pi
